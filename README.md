# wordFinder
Wanna find a word on multiple webpages?

Well look no further


Run the findWord.py script
Paste the url
Type the word you want to find
and let the magic work!

Preset wordlist of 0-100 for ebook pages

Will alter script to include adding your own wordlist to find webpages


ex: Im looking for a work in the ebook and the path is /reader/5437/page/1/ for the url
    We can delete the "1/"
    And lets the script enumerate with the txt file to go through pages 0-100
    For finding the word faster


Little script I made because it makes my assignments easier
